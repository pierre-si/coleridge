      "{'section_title': 'Conclusions',\n 'text': 'We have recreated the Price approach for a set of 58 tropical '\n         'cyclones but were unable to duplicate the exact results that were '\n         'found in this study. However, we confirmed their broad conclusions '\n         'that the observed lightning variability is correlated to wind '\n         'variability and that on average, the lightning variation leads the '\n         'wind variation by ∼1 day. The Price approach has been extended from '\n         'the original 3 years of data to an 8 year data set which returns '\n         'broadly similar lag and correlation results when using a lightning '\n         'collection window of 10\\n'\n         '• square or of 500 km radius. The cross-correlation matching between '\n         'wind and lightning only has an ∼8% failure rate. We have calculated '\n         'both the 10\\n'\n         '• × 10\\n'\n         '• square lightning detection window, a radial distance in '\n         'kilometers, and performed the lightning to wind cross correlation '\n         'for a range of circular distances including toroidal rings. The '\n         'highest correlations were found for the < 300 km radial window with '\n         'a median linear correlation of 0.8. The calculated lag time for each '\n         'tropical cyclone using this < 300 km collection window shows a '\n         'double peak distribution at 0 and +66 h, at this smaller radius a '\n         'median or mean lag is not appropriate. The eyewall lightning at '\n         'distances < 50 km from the center of the storm provides only a '\n         'single peak around a zero time lag.\\n'\n         'These results suggest that the predictive timescale of lightning is '\n         'highly dependent upon which region of the cyclone is investigated. '\n         'When using a spatially large lightning collection window, our '\n         'results agree with other studies of high-category tropical cyclones '\n         '[e.g., Price et al., 2009; DeMaria et al., 2012; Pan et al., 2014] '\n         'of a ∼1 day value. When we look at the region containing the '\n         'eyewall, we find a 0 day value, indicating that eyewall lightning '\n         'cannot be used to predict wind intensification using this large '\n         'temporal-scale binning method. A case by case study looking at much '\n         'higher time resolutions near the eyewall would be required to look '\n         'for a potential predictive ability. We note that our results suggest '\n         'that if such a predictive relationship existed, it would provide no '\n         'more than 6 h advance warning. When we consider the < 300 km region '\n         '(rainband and eyewall) we find a double-peaked structure at ∼3 days '\n         '(agreeing with Pan et al.

However, we confirmed their broad conclusions '\n         'that lightning variability seems to be correlated to wind '\n         'variability and that on average, the lightning variation leads the '\n         'wind variation by ∼1 day. The Price approach has been extended from '\n         'the original 3 years of data to an 8 year dataset which returns '\n         'broadly similar lag and correlation results when using a lightning '\n         'collection window of 10 • square or of 500 km radius. The cross '\n         'correlation matching between wind and lightning only has an ∼8% '\n         'failure rate. We have calculated both the 10 • x 10 • square '\n         'lightning detection window, a radial distance in kilometers, and '\n         'performed the lightning to wind cross correlation for a range of '\n         'circular distances including toroidal rings. The highest '\n         'correlations were found for the < 300 km radial window with a median '\n         'linear correlation of 0.8. The calculated lag time for each tropical '\n         'cyclone using this < 300 km collection window, shows a double peak '\n         'distribution at 0 and +66 hours, at this smaller radius a median or '\n         'mean lag is not appropriate. The eyewall lightning at distances < 50 '\n         'km from the center of the storm provides only a single peak around a '\n         'zero time lag. These results suggest that the predictive timescale '\n         'of lightning is highly dependent upon which region of the cyclone is '\n         'investigated. When using a spatially large lightning collection '\n         'window our results agree with other studies of high category '\n         'tropical cyclones [e.g., Price, Mustafa and Yair , 2009;DeMaria et '\n         'al., 2012;Pan, Qie and Wang, 2014] of a ∼1 day value. When we look '\n         'at the region containing the eyewall we find a 0 day value, '\n         'indicating that eyewall lightning cannot be used to predict the wind '\n         'evolution. When we consider the < 300 km region (rainband and '\n         'eyewall) we find a double peaked structure at ∼3 days (agreeing with '\n         'Pan, Qie and Wang [2014] for weak tropical cyclones) and 0 days. '\n         'This 0 day lag is independent of the eyewall correlation peak, '\n         'confirmed by the 150-300 km window showing the same double peak '\n         'structure. Acknowledgments.

      "[{'section_title': 'Conclusion',\n  'text': 'We have proposed the use of a maximum likelihood structural '\n          'equation model for combining SNP data and structural brain area '\n          'measurements. The model makes use of external gene expression data, '\n          'to define groups of brain regions that may respond similarly to '\n          'genetic variation. For each of these region groups, we define a '\n          'latent variable, which captures the relationship between the '\n          'regions in a group and genetic variation. We have applied the model '\n          'on a simulated dataset, to show it can capture disease relevant '\n          'variation and identify causal SNPs. In addition, we have applied '\n          \"the model to the ADNI dataset, containing Alzheimer's patients, \"\n          'individuals with late mild cognitive impairment, and cognitive '\n          'healthy controls. One SNP, linked to APOE, shows a reproducible '\n          'significant relationship to the latent variable that captures '\n          'hippocampal volume change. This latent variable, and that of the '\n          'cerebral cortex, amygdala, and sulci & spaces also significantly '\n          'associate with the disease diagnosis. This shows that our approach '\n          'can be used to integrate several data types, and yield '\n          'interpretable results.\\n'\n          'The fitting process of the structural equation model has relatively '\n          'high computational cost. It is truly multivariate, which makes it '\n          'infeasible at the moment to perform genome-wide analysis. It does '\n          'have advantages for incorporating a large number of variables, '\n          'since it allows for straightforward inclusion of constraints on the '\n          'parameter estimates [20] . With a constraint on the sum of squared '\n          'weights, one could for instance implement a ridge regression. In '\n          'addition, the model allows for the inclusion of additional data. '\n          'This can be done either in the specification of the model '\n          'structure, as we have done for the region groups, or by adding '\n          'observed variables to the model.\\n'\n          'These results show that maximum likelihood SEM is a versatile '\n          'approach for data integration, which can be used to elucidate the '\n          'relationships between genetic variation, structural brain '\n          'phenotypes, and brain disease.'},\n {'section_title': 'Supporting information',\n  'text': 'Supplemental Fig 1 Weights (loadings) from the latent variables to '\n          'the region measurements. The rows correspond to latent variables '\n          '(region groups), and the columns to brain regions. Each first '\n          'loading per region group was set to 1, for model identifiability.

The '\n          '1964 M w 9.2 earthquake, with an epicenter on mainland Alaska about '\n          '70 km west of the town of Valdez (Fig. 1) , was the latest of these '\n          'megathrust earthquakes and remains the second largest '\n          'instrumentally recorded earthquake. Although large earthquakes '\n          'along the Alaska-Aleutian megathrust typically result from the '\n          'northward subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North '\n          'American plate, the PWS area includes the added subduction of the '\n          'Yakutat terrane that appears to locally override the Pacific plate '\n          '(e.g., Brocher et al., 1994; Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2006) .

To '\n          'date, there has been little direct evidence that these active splay '\n          'faults extend northeast beneath PWS, closer to the 1964 earthquake '\n          'epicenter and the population centers of Valdez and Cordova.\\n'\n          'The subduction of the relatively buoyant Yakutat terrane above the '\n          'Pacific plate and beneath the North American plate produces a '\n          'shallow subduction angle compared with farther west where only '\n          'Pacific plate rocks are being subducted (Brocher et al., 1994; '\n          'Eberhart-Phillips et al., 2006; Fuis et al., 2008) .

Although '\n          'Plafker (1969) documented no vertical displacement on individual '\n          'faults on the islands of eastern PWS, upwards of 2 m of regional '\n          'tectonic uplift may indicate coseismic slip on submarine faults in '\n          'this area.\\n'\n          'In 2009 and 2011, we collected high-resolution marine '\n          'seismic-reflection profiles to characterize Holocene depositional '\n          'patterns and to identify active faults beneath PWS.

Finally, we present a crustal-scale '\n          'seismic profile that shows the identified faults splay from the '\n          'megathrust interface. We show that PWS landslides and fault '\n          'ruptures have repeatedly been active during the past few thousand '\n          'years and that these hazards may initiate independently or in '\n          'concert with a great megathrust earthquake.'},\n {'section_title': 'The 1964 Great Alaska Earthquake',\n  'text': 'The 1964 M w 9.2 Great Alaska earthquake caused 115 fatalities in '\n          'Alaska and more than $300 million (1964 dollars) in damage to '\n          'Alaska infrastructure, despite the sparse population at the time '\n          '(Haas, 1973) .

The Hanning Bay and Patton Bay faults had 5 and 10 m of '\n          'differential vertical slip on Montague Island, respectively '\n          '(Plafker, 1969) , but the greatest vertical uplift was located '\n          'beneath the shallow waters immediately west of Montague Island.

This contrasts with motion on mainland Alaska, which is currently '\n          'moving at the North American plate rate and direction (e.g., Zweck '\n          'et al., 2002) . Although the entire PWS region was uplifted in '\n          '1964, geodetic data show that central PWS has been gradually '\n          'subsiding since the earthquake, consistent with a locked megathrust '\n          'interface (Freymueller et al., 2008) . The relatively moderate '\n          'interseismic subsidence contrasts with the estimated '\n          'millennial-scale exhumation rates of greater than 1 mm=yr recorded '\n          'with thermochronology methods for rocks in the hanging wall of the '\n          'Patton Bay megathrust splay fault (Arkle et al., 2013; Ferguson et '\n          'al., 2015; Haeussler et al., 2015) . Hence, coseismic uplift rates '\n          'have outpaced interseismic subsidence rates in the hanging wall of '\n          'these splay faults for PWS throughout the Quaternary record. North '\n          'of this region in PWS, the thermochronology data indicate that the '\n          'interseismic subsidence has nearly matched coseismic uplift for '\n          'more than 10 Ma, resulting in little elevation change . Doser et '\n          'al. (2008) characterized PWS seismicity and determined that thrust '\n          'fault earthquakes are dominant in the upper crust above about 14 km '\n          'depth. Post-1964 earthquake upper-plate seismicity forms clusters '\n          'that are concentrated at several areas beneath PWS, including the '\n          'Smith and Knight Island regions ( Fig. 1 ; Doser and Brown, 2001; '\n          'Fuis et al., 2008; Li et al., 2013) . Although deformation and '\n          'seismic moment release have been relatively low in the years '\n          'following the 1964 earthquake (e.g., Doser et al., 2004) , numerous '\n          'M w > 4 upper-plate earthquakes have been identified beneath and '\n          'south of eastern PWS since 1964 (Fig. 1) . These earthquakes likely '\n          'originated along faults that splay from the megathrust at '\n          'approximately 20 km depth (e.g., Brocher et al., 1994) .\\n'\n          'Past geophysical surveys shed light on the tectonic framework for '\n          'PWS and the nearby Gulf of Alaska areas.

If these faults extend west beneath the central PWS '\n          'region or east into mainland Alaska, larger earthquakes are '\n          'possible from this fault system.'},\n {'section_title': 'Central PWS Active Faults',\n  'text': 'We present four new sparker seismic profiles and the TACT-D '\n          'seismic-reflection profile that image strata and structure beneath '\n          'the central PWS waterway between Orca Bay and Knight Island. This '\n          'main shipping channel extends from Hinchinbrook Entrance to the '\n          'port communities of Valdez and Whittier (Fig. 1) . Our sparker '\n          'seismic profiles reveal layered deposition, fluvial channeling, and '\n          'in places bedrock forming the seafloor. When we interpret the '\n          'seismic data in conjunction with seafloor bathymetry, we identify '\n          'and characterize the active faults that lie beneath central PWS and '\n          'that splay from the ∼20-km-deep megathrust boundary at the top of '\n          'the subducting plate (Fig. 5) .\\n'\n          'Extending from Orca Bay to central PWS, sparker profile Orca 1 '\n          'reveals a 50 m bedrock (unit IV) high juxtaposed against Holocene '\n          'strata (units I and II; Fig. 4 ). Although we cannot state with '\n          'certainty that this bedrock knob is fault controlled, the southward '\n          'thinning of unit I strata onto this bedrock surface is consistent '\n          'with growth faulting. Along strike of the Orca 1 profile and at '\n          'position 31 km on seismic profile CS4 (inset in Fig. 4e ), we '\n          'identify a 1.1-m vertical step of the seafloor (from detailed '\n          'bathymetric measurements) and about a 3-m vertical step across the '\n          'NGU that separates units I and II (Fig. 4) . We also identify a '\n          '10-m offset of the reflector at the base of unit II, and more than '\n          '50-m offset separates the truncated reflectors of unit III from the '\n          'unit IV Orca Group bedrock. Based on truncated reflectors, we '\n          'interpret an ∼65°N dipping active thrust fault. The increase in '\n          'offset with depth suggests that the fault we term the Central Sound '\n          'fault (CSF) has remained active throughout late Quaternary time. '\n          'Given the extremely rapid late Holocene deposition rates, we '\n          'presume that most of the 1.1-m seafloor offset occurred during the '\n          '1964 earthquake. If the base of unit I represents the 4-ky NGU '\n          'boundary and the base of unit II represents the onset of post LGM '\n          'deposition at 12 ky, our measured offsets suggest a Holocene slip '\n          'rate of approximately 0:75 mm=yr. Thus, slip from the 1964 '\n          'earthquake represents more than the average vertical motion per '\n          'earthquake on this fault, assuming five post-NGU earthquakes '\n          '(Carver and Plafker, 2008) . Alternatives to this interpretation '\n          'are that the CSF was not active during all of the post-NGU '\n          'earthquakes or that depositional rates have changed over the past '\n          'few thousand years. This presumed higher than average slip from '\n          '1964 on the CSF is in contrast to the lower than average 1964 slip '\n          'estimates for the Orca Bay faults. However, our observations '\n          'suggest measurably different fault slip between earthquakes. Placed '\n          'in a larger context though, the late Holocene motion on the CSF and '\n          'Orca Bay fault is nearly an order of magnitude less than slip on '\n          'the Patton Bay and Cape Cleare faults near the southern margin of '\n          'Montague Island ( Fig. 1 ; Liberty et al., 2013) .\\n'\n          'We identify the CSF on additional sparker seismic profiles and as a '\n          'seafloor scarp that bisects the Smith Islands beneath central PWS '\n          '(Fig. 4) . On sparker seismic profile CS3, the CSF offsets the '\n          'seafloor by 3.2 m, the NGU by about 5 m, and the bedrock by ∼130 m. '\n          'Profile CS5 shows water bottom and NGU offsets of 4 and 10 m, '\n          'respectively, and the seafloor offset near the Smith Islands '\n          'records an offset of nearly 6 m. Because Plafker (1969) recorded '\n          'only ∼1:5 m vertical uplift during the 1964 earthquake on nearby '\n          'islands, we presume that the seafloor uplift along these profiles '\n          'does not represent uplift from only the 1964 earthquake. The 5-10 m '\n          'offset across the NGU near the Smith Islands does suggest a larger '\n          'average fault displacement per earthquake than on the CS4 profile '\n          'to the east. This increase in uplift to the west is consistent with '\n          'exhumation patterns recorded from thermochronology data that '\n          'average over thousands of earthquake cycles (Arkle et al., 2013;  '\n          'et al., 1994) with earthquake hypocenters of M w > 2 (from Doser et '\n          'al., 2008) and interpreted faults that splay from the megathrust.

'\n          'We interpret a series of nearly flat-lying reflectors (an average '\n          'northward dip of 1°-3°) at ∼20 km depth to represent the low-angle '\n          'subduction decollement surface. The overlying reflectors dip gently '\n          'to the north, and the reflector dips increase at shallow depths. We '\n          'interpret these north-dipping reflectors to be thrust faults that '\n          'splay from the megathrust.

A second fault splays from the megathrust to the south of '\n          'the CSF and projects to the surface south of the TACT-D profile. '\n          'This latter splay fault is consistent with the positioning of the '\n          'RRF system near Hinchinbrook Entrance and is likely responsible for '\n          'the tilted reflectors in the footwall portion of the CSF (shown on '\n          'CS4) and the shallow bedrock depth near Hinchinbrook Entrance.\\n'\n          'The portion of the TACT-D profile to the north of Naked Island '\n          'shows little evidence for upper-crustal reflectors below the '\n          'Holocene sedimentary basins and seafloor bedrock exposures.

In addition, the lack of upperplate reflectors is consistent '\n          'with few mapped thrust faults in this part of PWS and slow rates of '\n          'long-term exhumation compared with other portions of PWS (Arkle et '\n          'al., 2013; Haeussler et al., 2015) .'},\n {'section_title': 'Discussion and Conclusions',\n  'text': 'Much of eastern and central PWS has had very high rates of late '\n          'Holocene sedimentation, and we identify active reverse faults that '\n          'offset these young sediments. The CSF extends westward from the '\n          'Smith Islands and east to Orca Bay (Fig. 4) and lineaments related '\n          'to active faults define the northern margin of the deepest basin in '\n          'Orca Bay. East of Orca Bay, lineaments and reverse faults are '\n          'mapped on land (Condon, 1965; Plafker, 1969; Bol and Roeske, 1993; '\n          'Wilson and Hults, 2012) , and these lineations are possible onland '\n          'continuations of the Orca Bay faults. We do not see a clear link '\n          'between seafloor traces of the CSF and Orca Bay faults, and they '\n          'may represent individual faults of an en echelon fault system.

However, the total '\n          'vertical slip of a few meters along the NGU horizon within eastern '\n          'and central PWS is small compared with offsets recorded southwest '\n          'of Montague Island , suggesting that the former area has likely not '\n          'been the central focus of M w 9 late Holocene earthquake surface '\n          'ruptures.\\n'\n          'Faults and lineations related to the RRF that surfaces on '\n          'Hinchinbrook Island indicate a thrust component (Carver and '\n          'McCalpin, 1996) and may extend beneath Hinchinbrook Entrance to '\n          'Montague Island to form a > 30-km-long fault system (Fig. 5) . '\n          'Although these faults show no measured displacement from the 1964 '\n          'earthquake, this fault system has likely been active during '\n          'previous Holocene earthquakes and we suggest it should be regarded '\n          'as high hazard.\\n'\n          'Beneath and around PWS, mapped faults follow the contours of the '\n          'continental coastline (e.g., Wilson and Hults, 2012) .

The transition from '\n          'north-east-striking faults beneath western PWS to east-striking '\n          'faults beneath eastern PWS does not reflect differing generations '\n          'of active faults but corupturing faults related to the same '\n          'subduction zone processes.\\n'\n          'The data and interpretations presented here add to the growing body '\n          'of evidence that splay faults emanating from megathrust systems '\n          'represent substantial seismic hazards and can cause surface '\n          'ruptures more than 150 km landward of the toe of an accretionary '\n          'prism. In the case of PWS, these faults splay from the nearly '\n          'horizontal megathrust in an area where crustal duplexing is '\n          'present.

The home-delivered '\n          'meals program is designed to address problems of food insecurity, '\n          'promote socialization, and promote the health and well-being of '\n          'older persons through nutrition and nutrition-related services '\n          '(Colello 2011). Home-delivered meals are often the first in-home '\n          'service that older adults receive and can often serve as a primary '\n          'access point for other HCBS (Administration on Aging 2012). '\n          'Home-delivered meals also provide an essential service to '\n          'caregivers, by helping them maintain their own health and '\n          'well-being. In addition, home-delivered meal services provide more '\n          'than just food to recipients (Choi 1999). Drivers are often the '\n          'eyes and ears who serve as a \"safety check\" and report changing '\n          'health or needs of home-bound older adults. In addition, any '\n          'unanswered delivery is reported and investigated. Oftentimes, those '\n          'who deliver food also provide companionship to people who otherwise '\n          'might be alone all day. Investment in home-delivered meals may be '\n          'one of the mechanisms that help to keep low-care individuals out of '\n          'the NH. Predictors of NH entry include demographic characteristics, '\n          'socioeconomic status, health status and physical functioning, '\n          'living arrangements and family structure, and availability of '\n          'support (Miller and Weissert 2000;Gaugler et al. 2007). A 2009 '\n          'survey of home-delivered meals recipients found that 70 percent '\n          'were age 75 and older, 56 percent lived alone, 25 percent had an  '\n          '(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009) annual '\n          'income of $10,000 or less, and 59 percent said that the '\n          'home-delivered meals program provided at least one-half of their '\n          'daily food intake (Altshuler and Schimmel 2010). This survey also '\n          'found that 4 of 10 home-delivered meals recipients reported needing '\n          'help with one or more of the ADLs and 85 percent reported needing '\n          'help with one or more instrumental ADLs (Altshuler and Schimmel '\n          '2010). This suggests that these individuals are particularly '\n          'vulnerable and receiving meals may allow them to be maintained in '\n          'the community. While the home-delivered meals program is the '\n          'largest of the OAA programs, it does not reach all of those in '\n          'need. It is reported that nearly 4.5 million older adults living in '\n          'the community need long-term care (Rogers and Komisar 2003). Among '\n          'people 65 and older, estimates are that 14 percent need long-term '\n          'care while among people age 85+, half need some long-term care. In '\n          'fiscal year 2010, the home-delivered meals program through the OAA '\n          'provided meals to 868,076 participants (Administration on Aging '\n          '2012). There are also many who are on waiting lists to receive '\n          'these services  (Day 2012). Therefore, expanding the funding and '\n          'targeting services to reach these millions of older adults who need '\n          'assistance may decrease the proportion of low-care residents in '\n          'NHs. The United States has made significant progress toward '\n          'expanding HCBS, mainly through Medicaid HCBS waiver programs. '\n          'However, our study indicated that the proportion of Medicaid '\n          'spending going toward HCBS did not have a differential effect on '\n          'the prevalence of low-care residents over time. Because low-care '\n          'residents in this study could either be Medicaid eligible, Medicaid '\n          'LTC eligible, or non-Medicaid eligible, the lack of association '\n          'between increased Medicaid HCBS investment and decreased prevalence '\n          'of low-care residents could likely be because some low-care '\n          'residents are not Medicaid eligible. Future research should seek to '\n          'determine whether the level of generosity of Medicaid eligibility '\n          'levels may have an effect on the proportion of low-care residents '\n          'in NHs. In particular, there is considerable variability in the '\n          'eligibility levels for the medically needy program from state to '\n          'state. It may be the case that in states with the most stringent '\n          'requirements, frail, older individuals who are not quite eligible '\n          'for Medicaid are not eligible for Medicaid HCBS and so enter NHs '\n          'since they will rapidly become eligible for Medicaid residing '\n          'there. A major strength of this study lies in the use of a 10-year '\n          'longitudinal multilevel dataset, which allowed examination of state '\n          'HCBS spending on the prevalence of low-care residents that occurred '\n          'over years. Obviously, we are not in a position to state '\n          'unequivocally that increased OAA investment prevents NH admission '\n          'among low-care individuals since these are observational data. '\n          'Nonetheless, we controlled for national trends, Medicaid spending, '\n          'and tested for the effect of changes in OAA investments over time, '\n          'thereby addressing history and some state endogeneity. Use of a '\n          \"fixed effect model meant that real changes in facilities' \"\n          'proportion of low-care residents were independent of facility and '\n          'market characteristics, all suggesting that these findings are more '\n          'robust than many earlier studies that have examined these issues '\n          'using cross-sectional data. Nonetheless, it is also necessary to '\n          \"note the study's limitations. Our study is predicated upon the \"\n          'validity of the MDS functional assessment data and the assumption '\n          'that residents who do not require skilled clinical services or '\n          'assistance meeting their ADLs could be sustained in the community. '\n          'Also, the lack of a specific level of cognitive functioning as an '\n          'exclusion criterion for low care in this and previous research '\n          'warrants further examination. While older adults diagnosed with '\n          'dementia may be more likely in need of NH placement than older '\n          'adults without (Temple, Andel, and Dobbs 2010), research (Buttar, '\n          'Blaum, and Fries 2001) that has examined the cognitive status of '\n          'low-care residents suggests that, in general, low-care residents '\n          'have significantly better cognitive functioning compared with other '\n          'NH residents (73 percent of the low-care residents in that study '\n          'had either little or no cognitive impairment). Although some '\n          'individuals identified as low-care residents under the present '\n          'criteria may also have cognitive impairment, we believe that '\n          'substantial cognitive impairment would be reflected in the ability '\n          'to perform ADLs. In addition, we did not distinguish between the '\n          'types of low-care residents by Medicaid eligibility. Increased '\n          'investment in OAA is more likely to affect the general population '\n          'of older adults while increased investments in Medicaid funded HCBS '\n          'are likely to only decrease the prevalence of low-care residents in '\n          'NHs who are Medicaid or Medicaid LTC eligible. The use of state '\n          'reported expenditure data does leave us to question the validity '\n          'and consistency of the data from state to state. However, because '\n          'we chose programs that require extensive client information to '\n          'receive services, we believe that the record keeping and reporting '\n          'would be more standardized from state to state. These data have '\n          'been used in previous research and government reports; therefore, '\n          'we deem them appropriate for this study question (Kitchener et al. '\n          '2007;Colello 2011; United States Government Accountability Office '\n          '2011). Another potential limitation is the use of older adults aged '\n          '65+ to adjust for OAA spending rather than the number of older '\n          'adults aged 60+, for whom the federal dollars are allocated. '\n          'However, census data only report projections for the aggregate '\n          'numbers of 65+ in each year and OAA requires Title III programs to '\n          'target or make it a priority to serve older adults with the '\n          'greatest economic and social need. Therefore, we believe adjusting '\n          'for the number of older adults aged 65+ in the state is appropriate '\n          'and has been done elsewhere to present these data (United States '\n          'Government Accountability Office 2011). As the United States '\n          'prepares for an aging population and the demand for health and '\n          'social services necessary to assist older adults to live '\n          'independently in the community increases, ensuring access to HCBS '\n          'will likely continue to be an issue for policy makers. This article '\n          'reveals that despite efforts to rebalance LTC, there are still many '\n          'NH residents who have the functional capacity to live in a less '\n          'restrictive environment. States that have invested in their '\n          'community-based service networks, particularly home-delivered '\n          'meals, have proportionally fewer of these people than do those '\n          'states that have not. The challenge for states and CMS will be to '\n          'build and invest in systems and'},\n {'section_title': '1224',\n  'text': 'HSR: Health Services Research 48:3 (June 2013) programs that divert '\n          'unnecessary NH placement for individuals who can be sustained in '\n          'the community.'}]\n"

By 2013, when the pass rate '\n          'peaked at 78.3%, public and professional concerns about the '\n          'standard and quality of the examinations were raised (DBE, Republic '\n          'of South Africa, 2014b). Given the high status of the exit-level '\n          'examination results and the political imperative to improve the '\n          'pass rate, it was important to demonstrate to the public and '\n          'tertiary institutions that a rising pass rate is due to improved '\n          'learning rather than lower standards of the examinations.\\n'\n          'Comparing national standards year-on-year is only valid post-2008, '\n          'which was the first year in which all students wrote the same '\n          'national examinations, based on the same curriculum, and received '\n          'the National Senior Certificate (NSC). The minimum requirements for '\n          'a pass in the NSC are 40% in three subjects, one of which must be '\n          'Home Language, and 30% in a further three subjects.

Public criticism of the 18% increase in pass rates over '\n          'the period 2009-2013 led to the Minister of Basic Education '\n          'commissioning an independent task team to report on the standard '\n          'and quality of the NSC. It released its report in June, 2014. One '\n          'of its key findings was that the standard and quality of the NSC '\n          'was improving (DBE, Republic of South Africa, 2014b), although '\n          'there were still serious concerns about aspects of the examination '\n          'process. The contrasting views of the ministerial task team and '\n          'public critics point to different understandings of what we mean by '\n          '\"standards.\" The problem of how the British press and public '\n          'understand \"examination standards\" is the subject of several '\n          'research papers (see, for example, Baird, Cresswell & Newton, 2000; '\n          'Coe, 2010) .

A new curriculum (the National '\n          'Curriculum Statement, or NCS) was examined for the first time in '\n          '2008. Thus, increasing pass rates from 2009 onwards could be '\n          'attributed to increasing familiarity with the NCS and the style of '\n          'the examination papers, thereby decreasing the difficulty of the '\n          'examinations. As from 2014, all examinations were set on a revised '\n          'NCS, known as the Curriculum and Assessment Policy Statement '\n          '(CAPS). The South African exit-level examinations are rigorously '\n          'monitored by Umalusi. To compensate for unanticipated variations in '\n          'the mark distribution, a standardisation process sees the marks for '\n          'the current year adjusted to match the average frequency '\n          'distribution curve for the previous three to five years (Umalusi, '\n          '2016) .

'\n          'Similar adjustments in 2015 were justified on the grounds that the '\n          'examination papers were \"demonstrably more difficult\" than previous '\n          \"years' papers (Umalusi, 2015e) . The large-scale upwards \"\n          'adjustments in 2016 were criticised by many commentators, including '\n          'opposition politicians (Davis, 2016) and commentators (Jansen, '\n          '2017) , on the grounds of declining standards of the examination '\n          'papers.'},\n {'section_title': 'Life Sciences in the NSC',\n  'text': 'Life Sciences has an enrolment of close to 300,000 students in the '\n          'NSC.

The incidence is increasing as the population is aging. Due to the increasing trend of Alzheimer's disease, there is a lot of discussion on prevention efforts or slowing the incidence. Also, models that could predict individual risk of cognitive impairment are needed to assist in prevention efforts.\\nIn general dementia development has been associated with growth in various vascular, lifestyle and other risk factors. Epidemiological research provides evidence of some vascular, lifestyle and psychological risk factors that are modifiable and protective of disease incidence either independently or while interacting with other factors. However, as reported by National Institute of Aging, it is not yet clear whether health or lifestyle factors can prevent Alzheimer's disease.\\nThe objective of this research project is to adopt a system dynamics modeling approach to study the interaction of several key factors including vascular, lifestyle and psychological aspects over the life course of individuals, to gain further understanding of Alzheimer's disease incidence and evaluate prevention strategies. Both datasets of 'Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)' and 'Health and Retirement Study (HRS)' will be used for model development and validation.\\nA system dynamics approach is an optimal choice for addressing the goal of this proposal because different key factors interact over time and make Alzheimer's disease incidence a complex problem. Furthermore, system dynamics approaches focus on understanding the relationship between the structure of a system and the resulting dynamic behaviors generated through multiple interacting feedback loops. Such an approach could be invaluable in studying dynamic problems arising in complex health, social, economic, or ecological systems.\\nFor the purpose of the proposal, the following stages are planned:\\n1.

The function being optimized has many characteristics that are relevant for optimization but are typically not well understood. Due to that complexity, most authors have used a simple gradient descent, but it is not often discussed how step sizes are chosen or if line searches are used. Further, if a system is to be robust to a range of input images, that may differ to varying degrees, the optimization must be adaptable. Here, we present two methods of adaptable gradient descent with line searches, and test how they affect image registration. The optimization schemes are deployed for geodesic shooting in diffeomorphisms -an approach that is used to quantify anatomical changes, such as atrophy, in longitudinal image pairs. We evaluate the optimization schemes on their convergence characteristics and based on how well the resulting atrophy scores correlate with diagnostic group and mini mental state exam (MMSE) scores. We find that the Barzilai-Borwein method with a backtracking line search outperforms other optimization schemes in convergence time and adaptability by a wide margin. We also find that the variable optimization schemes do not significantly affect the ability to measure atrophy with clinical significance.'}, {'section_title': 'INTRODUCTION', 'text': 'The LDDMM (large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping) framework for diffeomorphic image registration is described in significant procedural detail in the seminal paper by Beg et al. [1] . LDDMM proposes encoding the shape difference evident in two images of the same anatomy as a point on a manifold of diffeomorphisms. The objective of the algorithm is to construct a path on that manifold beginning at the identity and ending at the diffeomorphism that optimally matches the two images; Beg et al. show that at optimality the path is a geodesic. In the geodesic shooting formulation, the path is parameterized by an initial momentum vector field, from which the entire geodesic can be reconstructed by integrating the appropriate Euler-Poincaré differential equation (EPdiff) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6] . Also, Miller et al. [2] show that at optimality, the initial momentum vector field is proportional to the spatial gradient of the moving image. Hence, the objective of geodesic shooting in diffeomorphisms (GSiD) is to find a scalar momentum field that parameterizes an optimal matching between the given images.\\nAn implementation of GSiD can be viewed as having three mathematical components: (1) construction of the model itself, which can include decisions about representation [6] and selection of parameters that dictate properties of the space of diffeomorphisms [7] , (2) numerical integration of differential equations [3] , and (3) an optimization procedure for the initial momentum field. The majority of work in the field has been in areas (1) and (2), with substantially less attention to paid to (3) . With the exception of [5] , most studies report using gradient descent with some step size , though details of the procedure including the determination of , are typically omitted. Very little information relevant to optimization is known about the GSiD objective function, such as its smoothness and curvature characteristics. Further, it is not known how variable these characteristics are to different inputs. Nonetheless, to build a GSiD system robust to variable inputs, some optimization procedure must be selected.\\nWe consider here gradient descent with three different procedures to determine the step size : (1) a static step size, (2) a secant method line search, and (3) the Barzilai-Borwein method [8] . Methods (2) and (3) compute the step size at every iteration using limited local curvature data estimated from the objective function; hence, is adaptable to the inputs and the particular iteration of the optimization.'}, {'section_title': 'METHODS', 'text': ''}, {'section_title': 'GSiD', 'text': 'A complete discussion of the GSiD model is beyond the scope of this paper; for a thorough discussion of the following equations see [3] . For a moving image I and fixed image J, the GSiD objective function is:\\nwhich must be minimized with respect to the initial scalar momentum field P 0 . A given initial momentum provides the initial conditions for the EPdiff equation(s), which govern the time evolution of the momentum and moving image:\\nThe third equation states the relationship between momentum and velocity, where K plays the role of an inertia; K is a smoothing kernel and K(w) is taken to mean the convolution of vector field w with K. The path of diffeomorphisms φ t is constructed from v(x, t) according to the ODE:\\nThis yields the geodesic path of diffeomorphisms φ t , where the end point φ 1 is used to match I and J. The matching residual\\n1 , which resides in the coordinate system of J, must be brought back to the coordinate system of I while respecting the geodesicity of the whole path φ t . This is done by integrating the adjoint system backwards in time with initial conditionsÎ\\nP 0 completes the gradient of equation (1) with respect to P 0 . In a gradient descent scheme, that gradient is used to update P 0 :\\nis one of the few user selected parameters in the GSiD model. A poor selection of can result in intractable compute times (if the user insists on running to convergence), subconvergent results (if the optimization is stopped early due to time considerations), or numerical instability and divergence (if is too large). We are concerned in particular with the application of GSiD to longitudinal MRI time series of the brain to quantify atrophy. In that application, deformations are typically very low amplitude even relative to the spatial resolution of the images. Despite that, atrophy of as little as 5% in critical brain areas can have a significant impact on quality of life [9] . Hence, it is crucial to measure longitudinal deformations with the highest degrees of accuracy and precision possible. In such a case, the selection of can be critical to ensuring accurate and unbiased measurements.'}, {'section_title': 'Adaptable gradient descent steps', 'text': \"The simplest option is to select a priori a static value for which is fixed throughout the optimization. This value may perform well for some instances of data, and poorly for others. Even for a fixed input, it may perform well for a subset of iterations and poorly for others. We include this option as a baseline for comparison with more intelligent choices. The secant line search method: Suppose we would like to optimize a function f (x) by gradient descent. Then, for iteration k, we would like to minimize f (x k − k f (x k )) with respect to k . Take the truncated Taylor expansion (we temporarily omit the subscript k):\\nIf used directly, the second-order term will require the Hessian matrix of f . GSiD is a very high-dimensional optimization, hence the Hessian matrix f is intractable. We can replace the second-order term in the Taylor expansion with a finite difference approximation on the gradients:\\nSubstitute (7) into (6), apply the remaining partial derivative, and further differentiate each side with respect to . You will arrive at the expression:\\nFinally, we set this equal to zero and solve for . Also, to use this formula for GSiD we must account for the metric in the space of momenta; the inner products must include the operator K. With these two final steps we arrive at the formula:\\nWhere f k = f (x k ). Essentially, the secant method approximates the objective function in the gradient direction as a parabola, the curvature of which is estimated by formula (7).\\nBecause the function may not be well estimated locally as a parabola, for a given gradient descent iteration k, formula (8) is applied iteratively giving a series of steps k , which leverages every gradient computation efficiently. σ 0 k is set to a default value. This line search is stopped after a certain number of fixed iterations or when the magnitude of the update f k falls below a threshold. Note, though we must evaluate multiple gradients during the line search iterations, we only move in the direction f k until the line search is stopped and we move to gradient descent iteration k + 1. The Barzilai-Borwein method: We derive the method assuming\\nThe gradient is then f = Ax − b and the Hessian is f = A. Newton's method, a second-order optimization that accounts for the curvature of the objective function, proceeds as x k+1 = x k − A −1 f k . (For a symmetric positive definite quadratic form, this will converge in a single step and is equivalent to Gaussian elimination). The objective of the Barzilai-Borwein (BB) method is to let be determined by the simplest possible approximation to Newton's method:\\nFor the quadratic form, A satisfies As k = y k . So, we will let be the solution to the least squares problem:\\nwhich has the closed-form solution:\\nAgain, to apply this to GSiD we must account for the metric in the space of momenta:\\nSimilar to the secant method, the BB method approximates second-order information, but it does not require a second gradient computation. Even so, in some places formula (9) is likely to be a very poor approximation. It is well known that as a result, BB step sizes do not provide monotonic optimization; that is, occasionally k is too large. However, for nonlinear optimization, some degree of nonmonotonicity may be desired as it may help escape spurious local minima. Hence, the BB method is often coupled with a backtracking line search [10] . In our case, k is iteratively cut in half until the first Wolfe condition is satisfied:\\nwhere max (k−M,0) ≤ j ≤ k. M controls the degree of monotonicity (we use M = 10) and γ is related to our expectation of the objective function's local curvature. γ is typically chosen to be small (we use γ = 10 −4 ). Fig. 1 . Region of interest with significant atrophy in AD, used here to compute atrophy scores\"}, {'section_title': 'EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS', 'text': \"We took 100 randomly chosen subjects from the ADNI-2 longitudinal MRI dataset -available at adni.loni.usc.edu -and registered their baseline scans to their 24-month follow-up scans using GSiD. We did these registrations under 5 different experimental conditions: static step sizes of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, the secant method with 0 k = 0.01, and the BB method with 0 = 0.01. For all approaches, the optimization was stopped when the gradient magnitude (relative to the initial gradient magnitude) fell below a chosen threshold, or after 300 iterations, whichever came first. Before GSiD, the images were preprocessed according to the protocol detailed in [11, 12] .\\nAfter GSiD, the Jacobian determinants of the deformations mapping the baseline to the 24 month followup images were moved to a common coordinate system. The Jacobian determinants were averaged in a region where the rate of atrophy is significantly associated with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a stat-ROI, (Fig. 1) to produce a scalar value atrophy score that represents the percent volume loss within the region for each subject [9] . The region was constructed from a non-overlapping data set from that evaluated here. Figures 2 and 3 show convergence characteristics of the five optimizations strategies. Contrary to equation (1), we did not use sum of squared differences to drive the registration. We used the squared Local Correlation Coefficient (LCC) which is also used in [13] ; LCC increases as the images become better matched. Curves that do not extend the full 300 iterations are instances that stopped early due to the gradient magnitude stopping criterion. The largest static step size clearly causes oscillations in all instances. The smallest static step size did not permit any instances to complete be-fore reaching 300 iterations, it is likely that many instances are sub-convergent. The middle static step size appears to be a good compromise, but for many instances, the gradient magnitude oscillates. Apparently, none of the static step sizes is appropriate for all instances of the data or through all iterations of the optimization. The secant and BB methods show better convergence characteristics, with more instances finishing early. However, for the secant method not all instances converged. The spikes in the gradient magnitude for the BB method are due to the nonmonotonicity discussed above.\\nA good first question to ask is whether the choice of optimization procedure had a significant impact on atrophy scores. Figure 4 shows the p-values from paired t-tests between the measured atrophy scores for all pairs of optimization approaches. All five optimization procedures produced atrophy measurements that were significantly different from the others. Figure 3 also shows the average number of iterations and the number of instances that failed to converge due to numerical instability. In practice, the failed instances would have to be rerun with the parameters adjusted by hand. The BB method clearly had the fastest convergence, and was sufficiently adaptable that no instances failed to converge.\\nAtrophy measurements such as these have been shown to correlate with diagnostic category and performance on cognitive tests. The data set included subjects from four diagnostic categories: healthy controls (HC), early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI), late mild cognitive impairment (lMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Each subject also had a mini mental state exam (MMSE) administered at the 24 month follow up time point. The MMSE scores from 0 -30, where scores Figure  4 also shows Pearson's correlation coefficients between atrophy scores and diagnostic group and also between atrophy scores and MMSE scores for each of the five optimization approaches. The correlations appear sufficiently similar across optimization approaches to suggest that faster or more adaptable optimization approaches do not compromise the ability to measure clinically meaningful atrophy.\"}, {'section_title': 'ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS', 'text': 'The authors would like to thank Dr. Christian Clason for a helpful discussion on nonlinear optimization.
